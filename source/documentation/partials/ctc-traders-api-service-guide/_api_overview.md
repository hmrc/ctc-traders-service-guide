The CTC Traders API is based on REST principles with endpoints that return data in JSON format and it uses standard HTTP 
error response codes.

Use the API to:

- send departure and arrival movement notifications to the New Computerised Transit System (NCTS)
- retrieve messages sent from customs offices of departure and destination

You can use this version of the API to send both small (up to 5MB in size) and large (up to 8MB in size) messages. The 
large messages capability applies only to POST endpoints. 

The API endpoints relate only to Great Britain and Northern 
Ireland. You can also use the [HMRC sandbox environment](https://test-developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/sandbox/introduction) 
to run tests for Great Britain and Northern Ireland transit movements.
