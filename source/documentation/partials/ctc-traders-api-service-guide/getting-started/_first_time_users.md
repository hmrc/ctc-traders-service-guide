Traders new to the CTC Traders API must follow these steps:

- Confirm possession of an HMRC [developer account](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/developer/login). If none exists, [register for an account](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/developer/registration), activate it via email, and sign in.
- Add a subscription to the CTC Traders API within the application software.
- Understand the user-restricted [authentication](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/authorisation/user-restricted-endpoints) implemented by the API.
- [Create an application](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/developer/applications/) in the sandbox environment.
- Utilize the [Create Test User API](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api/service/api-platform-test-user/1.0) to generate one or more test users for the sandbox application.
- Download [NCTS reference data](https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/dds2/rd/rd_download_home.jsp?Lang=en) for testing purposes. 

Consult the CTC Traders API testing guide to verify software compatibility with this API version and to understand testing procedures in the sandbox environment.
