Pre-lodged declarations can be corrected as many times as required before a valid IE170 (‘Presentation Notification For The Pre-Lodged Declaration‘) message being accepted by the office of departure and an MRN being allocated by an IE028 (‘MRN Allocated‘) message.

Pre-lodged, simplified, and normal declarations can all be amended after the MRN has been allocated but before the IE029 (‘Release For Transit‘) message. Corrections or amendments are made by submitting an IE013 (‘Declaration Amendment‘) message:

- if message is successful, an IE004 (‘Amendment Acceptance‘) message will be received - but additional changes can be made by sending subsequent IE013 messages

- if message is unsuccessful and rejected, an IE056 (‘Rejection from Office of Departure‘) message will be received, and no change will be made to the declaration - but further IE013 messages can be used to make corrections or amendments as required before the declaration is either rejected (if it contains errors preventing release) or released (IE029)

The IE013 message type has two variants determined by the IE013 data element `Transit Operation > Amendment type flag`, which can be  `0` or `1`.

| Flag type | Usage                                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `1`       | Amendments of only the Guarantee data group | Use this flag type only when a movement has entered state 'Guarantee under amendment'. This state will be entered before movement release (IE029) as a consequence of an error in the Guarantee data group (in the IE015 message or subsequent IE013 message). Notification of the state will be received by means of an IE055 (Guarantee Not Valid) message, and an IE013 with flag type `1` will be expected to amend the guarantee. If this is not provided before the expiration of the guarantee awaiting amendment timer, the declaration will be rejected. |
| `0`       | All other amendment or correction attempts  | The list of data groups and elements that cannot be modified using an IE013 message can be found in rule [R0520](/guides/ctc-traders-phase5-tis/documentation/rules-r.html#r0520).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
