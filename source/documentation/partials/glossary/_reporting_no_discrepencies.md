If there are no discrepancies between what has arrived and what was declared (and released to transit after any amendments), the data element ‘UNLOADING REMARK.Conform‘ must be set to ‘1‘ (see rule [G0205](/guides/ctc-traders-phase5-tis/documentation/rules-g.html#g0205)) to indicate that there are no unloading remarks. If the IE044 message indicates that the goods conform with the declaration, consignment information is not required.
